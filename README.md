# ILAB-BKT
BKT unity component for study


This was an old abandoned repo.

It essentially is a BKT that can run in C#. It can take user's performance (right/wrong) either on binary or a scale (i don't remember) and publishes it.

The work never saw light of day but there's some good groundwork here
